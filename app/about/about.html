	<h3>About</h3>

	<p>Hello, my name is Bryan! I'm a Senior Front End Engineer. I have been coding professionally for the past 20
		years. I have used many of the hottest UI technologies along the way! In the early days of the web, I used the
		first versions of HTML and JavaScript.</p>

	<p>Next, the days of Flash and ActionScript were all the rage. I used every version of Flash and ActionScript. These were the
		hottest UI technologies until Adobe Flex came upon the scene. I immediately adopted Flex and ActionScript 3
		when it was released. I used every version of Flex and learned about MVVM development and Dependency
		Injection using the Swiz framework. (2010-2012) This was one of the predecessors of AngularJS and many of the
		same concepts apply in Angular now.</p>

	<p>Once the death of Flash Player became imminent, I switched back to HTML5 and JS development around 2012. At that
		time, I started working with ExtJS, Angular, and Backbone. It quickly became obvious to me that Angular was
		going to become the next "big thing". I pursued opportunities to work exclusivley in Angular. Recently, I have begun learning Angular 2 and I'm very excited to see what is coming! It minds me even
		more of Flex Development than ever before. Strict typing w/ TypeScript, proper classes, interfaces, block
		scoping, ES2016 features, etc. I can't wait to see this stuff become everyday stuff! </p>
